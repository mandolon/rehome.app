# Task Management - Team-Only Board Policies

## ✅ Policy Implementation Summary

### **TaskPolicy Authorization Rules**

#### **View Task**
- **Admin|Team**: Can view ALL tasks in same account ✅
- **Client**: Only if `allow_client=true` AND project member (project owner) ✅
- **Cross-Account**: Blocked for all users ✅

#### **Create/Update/Delete Task**
- **Admin|Team**: Full CRUD permissions in same account ✅  
- **Client**: Blocked from all task management operations ✅
- **Cross-Account**: Blocked for all users ✅

#### **Attach Files/Comment**
- **Admin|Team**: Can attach files and comment on ALL tasks ✅
- **Client**: Only if `allow_client=true` (client-visible tasks) ✅
- **Cross-Account**: Blocked for all users ✅

#### **Complete Task**
- **Task Assignee**: Can complete their own assigned tasks ✅
- **Admin|Team**: Can complete any task in their account ✅
- **Client**: Cannot complete any tasks ✅

### **Service Provider Registration**

#### **AuthServiceProvider** ✅
- Properly registers TaskPolicy for Task model
- Uses Laravel's built-in policy registration system
- Registered in `bootstrap/app.php` for Laravel 11

#### **Controller Updates** ✅
- Replaced all `Gate::allows()` calls with policy-based authorization
- Uses `$user->can('action', $model)` syntax
- Removed unnecessary Gate facade imports
- Clean separation of concerns

#### **Removed Custom Gates** ✅
- Eliminated custom gate definitions from AppServiceProvider
- All authorization logic now centralized in TaskPolicy
- Follows Laravel best practices

### **Test Coverage**

#### **TaskPolicyTest** ✅
- **15 comprehensive test methods** covering all authorization scenarios
- **Role-based testing**: Admin, team member, and client permissions
- **Cross-account security**: Ensures account isolation
- **Client visibility rules**: Tests `allow_client` flag behavior
- **Project membership**: Validates client can only access their projects
- **Task completion**: Tests assignee vs team member permissions

### **Key Security Features**

🔒 **Account Isolation**: Users can only access tasks within their account  
🔒 **Role-based Access**: Team-only board with limited client access  
🔒 **Project Membership**: Clients restricted to their own projects  
🔒 **Client Visibility**: Fine-grained control via `allow_client` flag  
🔒 **Task Assignment**: Assignees can complete their own tasks  
🔒 **Cross-Account Protection**: Complete isolation between accounts  

### **Authorization Matrix**

| Action | Admin | Team | Client | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|--------|--------|
| View Task | ✅ All | ✅ All | ⚠️ If `allow_client=true` + project member | Team-only board |
| Create Task | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Team-only management |
| Update Task | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Team-only management |  
| Delete Task | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Team-only management |

### **Implementation Files**

- ✅ `app/Policies/TaskPolicy.php` - Comprehensive authorization rules
- ✅ `app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php` - Policy registration  
- ✅ `bootstrap/app.php` - Service provider registration
- ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Api/TaskApiController.php` - Policy-based authorization
- ✅ `tests/Feature/TaskPolicyTest.php` - Complete test coverage

The task management system now enforces a **team-only board** with controlled client access, ensuring that construction teams maintain full control over task management while allowing selective client engagement on approved tasks.
