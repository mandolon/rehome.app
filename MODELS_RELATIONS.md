# Task Management - Models & Relations Implementation

## âœ… Task Model Relationships

### Belongs To Relations
- `belongsTo Project` âœ… - via `project_id`
- `belongsTo assignee(User)` âœ… - via `assignee_id`
- `belongsTo creator(User using created_by_id)` âœ… - via `created_by_id` (with both `createdBy()` and `creator()` methods)

### Has Many Relations  
- `hasMany taskFiles` âœ… - TaskFile model via `task_id`
- `hasMany activity (task_activity)` âœ… - TaskActivity model via `task_id` (with both `activities()` and `activity()` methods)

### Additional Relations
- `belongsToMany files` âœ… - Through task_files pivot table with metadata

## âœ… TaskFile Model Relationships

- `belongsTo Task` âœ… - via `task_id`
- `belongsTo File` âœ… - via `file_id`
- `belongsTo addedBy(User)` âœ… - via `added_by_id`

## âœ… TaskActivity Model Relationships

- `belongsTo Task` âœ… - via `task_id`
- `belongsTo User` âœ… - via `user_id`

## âœ… Model Events for File Count Management

### TaskFile Model Events
- **Created Event**: Automatically increments `tasks.files_count` when TaskFile is created âœ…
- **Deleted Event**: Automatically decrements `tasks.files_count` when TaskFile is deleted âœ…

### Updated Controller Logic
- **TaskApiController::attachFile()**: Removed manual increment - handled by model events âœ…
- **TaskApiController::detachFile()**: Removed manual decrement - handled by model events âœ…
- **Task::attachFile()**: Removed manual increment - handled by model events âœ…

## âœ… Related Model Updates

### User Model Task Relations
- `hasMany assignedTasks` âœ… - Tasks where user is assignee
- `hasMany createdTasks` âœ… - Tasks where user is creator
- `hasMany taskActivities` âœ… - All task activities by user

### Project Model Task Relations
- `hasMany tasks` âœ… - All tasks belonging to project

## âœ… Test Coverage

### TaskFileCountTest
- âœ… Files count increments when TaskFile created
- âœ… Files count decrements when TaskFile deleted  
- âœ… Multiple files count correctly
- âœ… All relationships work correctly

### TaskApiTest (Existing)
- âœ… Full CRUD operations
- âœ… Task actions (complete, assign, comment)
- âœ… File attachment/detachment via API
- âœ… Role-based authorization
- âœ… Filtering and search

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Summary

All requested model relationships and file count management have been implemented:

1. **Task Model**: Complete with all required relationships including dual accessors (`createdBy/creator`, `activities/activity`)
2. **TaskFile Model**: Proper relationships + automatic file count management via model events
3. **TaskActivity Model**: Clean relationships to Task and User
4. **File Count Management**: Fully automated through model events (no manual increment/decrement needed)
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for both relationships and file count automation
6. **Controller Updates**: Cleaned up manual count management in favor of automatic model events

The implementation follows Laravel best practices with model events handling the file count updates automatically, ensuring data consistency and reducing the chance of sync issues.
